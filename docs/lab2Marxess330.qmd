```{r}
library(dplyr)
tree_data <- read.csv("data/tree_dat.csv")
glimpse(tree_data)
```

**Question 1:**

```{r}
glimpse(tree_data)
```

The structure I see in this dataset is that there are 131,386 rows, and 8 columns: treeID, standID, stand, year, species, age, inc, and rad_ib. I see a mix of int, chr, and dbl data in the set.

**Question 2:**

```{r}
summary(tree_data$standID ==1)
```

I found that there are 979 records in stand 1.

Question 3:

```{r}
summary(tree_data$species[tree_data$species %in% c("ABBA", "PIST")])
```

I determined that there are 17221 records of the Abies balsamea and Pinus strobus species made in this data set.

**Question 4:**

```{r}
tree_data %>%
  filter(year == max(year), age > 200) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```

I determined that 7 trees are older than 200 years old in the last year of the data set

**Question 5:**

```{r}
tree_data %>%
  slice_max(order_by = age, n=1)
```

# 

I determined that the oldest tree in this dataset is 269 years old.

**Question 6:**

```{r}
tree_data %>% 
  filter(year == 2001) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = age, n = 5)
```

I found that the 5 oldest trees in 2001 were 263, 259, 212,206,and also 206 years old

**Question 7:**

```{r}
tree_data %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  slice_sample(prop = 0.3)%>%
  nrow()
```

I determined that 687 trees are in 30% sample of those recorded in 2002.

**Question 8:**

```{r}
tree_data %>%
  filter(standID == 5, year == 2007) %>%
  arrange(-rad_ib) %>%
  slice_head(n = 3) %>%
  select(treeID, rad_ib)
 
```

I got that the top 3 trees in stand 5 recorded in 2007, sorted by largest radius at breast height have the tree ID's of 128, 157, and 135.

**Question 9:**

```{r}
smallest_tree_3_2007 <- tree_data %>%
  filter(standID == 3, year == 2007) %>%
  slice_min(order_by = rad_ib, n = 3) %>%
  select(treeID, stand, year, rad_ib)
glimpse(smallest_tree_3_2007)
```

The smallest 3 trees recorded in 2007 had the ID's of 50,56, and 36.

**Question 10:**

```{r}
smallest_tree_3_2007_nostand <- smallest_tree_3_2007 %>%
  select(-stand)
glimpse(smallest_tree_3_2007_nostand)
```

**Question 11:**

```{r}
tree_data_IDs <- tree_data %>%
  select(contains("ID"))
glimpse(tree_data_IDs)
```

**Question 12:**

```{r}
tree_data_ID_stand <- tree_data %>%
  select(contains("ID"),contains("stand"))
glimpse(tree_data_ID_stand)
```

**Question 13:**

```{r}
tree_data <- tree_data %>%
  mutate(rad_inc_mm = inc, rad_ib_mm = rad_ib)
glimpse(tree_data)
```

**Question 14:**

```{r}
tree_data_mutated_q14 <- tree_data %>%
  mutate(
    rad_ib_cm = rad_ib / 10,
    DBH_cm = 2 * rad_ib_cm,  
    BA_m2 = 0.00007854 * (DBH_cm^2) 
  )
mean_BA_POTR_2007 <- tree_data_mutated_q14 %>%
  filter(species == "POTR", year == 2007) %>%
  summarise(mean_BA_m2 = mean(BA_m2, na.rm = TRUE))
print(mean_BA_POTR_2007)
```

The mean BA in m\^2 is 0.03696619, for POTR species in 2007

**Question 15:**

```{r}
tree_data_older <- tree_data %>%
  mutate(established = if_else(age > 5, TRUE, FALSE))
summary(tree_data$age)
table(tree_data$established)
colnames(tree_data)
tree_data_older %>%
  count(established)
```

# 

There are 122,503 trees that are "established" based on the criteria

**Question 16:**

```{r}

tree_data_mutated_w_Class <- tree_data_mutated_q14 %>%
  mutate(Class = case_when(
    DBH_cm > 0 & DBH_cm <= 2.5 ~ "Seedling",
    DBH_cm >2.5 & DBH_cm <= 10 ~"Sapling",
    DBH_cm >10 & DBH_cm <= 30 ~"Pole",
    DBH_cm >30 ~ "Sawlog",
    TRUE ~ as.character(NA)
  ))

classes_2007 <- tree_data_mutated_w_Class %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  group_by(Class) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
glimpse(classes_2007)
```

I found that no seedlings were measured, and there were 1963 Poles, 252 saplings and 76 sawlogs

**Question 17:**

```{r}
df_2007 <- tree_data_mutated_w_Class %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)
mean_dbh <- mean(df_2007$DBH_cm, na.rm = TRUE)
std_dbh <- sd(df_2007$DBH_cm, na.rm = TRUE)
glimpse(mean_dbh)
glimpse(std_dbh)
```

# 

I found that the mean DBH for the trees in 2007 was 16.1 cm and the standard deviation was 6.14cm.

**Question 18:**

```{r}
df_2003 <- tree_data %>%
  filter(year == 2003)
species_mean_age_03 <- df_2003 %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_age)) 

top_3_oldest_species <- species_mean_age_03 %>%
  head(3)

glimpse(top_3_oldest_species)
```

The 3 oldest species on average are THOC (126.6 years), FRNI (83.1 years ), and PIST (73.3 year).

**Question 19:**

```{r}
year_summary <- tree_data_mutated_q14 %>%
  summarise(
    unique_years = n_distinct(year),
    first_year = min(year, na.rm = TRUE),
    last_year = max(year, na.rm = TRUE))
glimpse(year_summary)
```

There are 111 unique years recorded, with the first year being 1897 and the last being 2007.

**Question 20:**

```{r}
stand_years <- tree_data %>%
  group_by(stand) %>%
  summarise(unique_years =n_distinct(year))
 Max_years <- max(stand_years$unique_years, na.rm = TRUE)
top_stands <- stand_years %>%
  filter(unique_years == Max_years)
glimpse(top_stands)

```

Stands A1, D1, D2, D3 and F1 have the most unique years, with 111 years of record.

**FINAL QUESTION**

```{r}
tree_growth <- tree_data_mutated_w_Class %>%
  group_by(treeID) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%  
  mutate(DBH_growth = DBH_cm - lag(DBH_cm)) 

print(head(tree_growth))  

valid_trees <- tree_growth %>%
  group_by(treeID) %>%
  filter(n() >= 10) 
  
species_growth <- valid_trees %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_growth = mean(DBH_growth, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_growth = sd(DBH_growth, na.rm = TRUE)
  )


fastest_species <- species_growth %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_growth)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 3)

slowest_species <- species_growth %>%
  arrange(mean_growth) %>%
  slice_head(n = 3)


print(fastest_species)
print(slowest_species)

```

I found that the 3 fastest growing species are PIRE, POTR, and PIBA, and the three slowest are LALA, THOC, and QURA.

![](images/Pinus_resinosa.jpg)

This is a Pinus resinosa tree, which I found to be be the fastest growing species, with a mean DBH growth of 0.358cm, and a standard deviation of DBH growth of 0.257cm.
